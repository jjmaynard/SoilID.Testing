SoilID Algorithm Testing
There are two forms of code testing:

1.	Code error testing: Testing for coding errors, i.e., does it run with all possible combination of inputs
2.	Code validation: Validation of the matching algorithm, i.e., how accurate is it.

Stage 1: Code error testing – ensure proper functioning of code given diversity of input data

1.	soilIDlist
    a.	Random sample
        i.	US: 2,500 random locations generated across US
        ii.	Global: ??
    b.	Pedon test datasets
        i.	US: 3,986 KSSL locations
        ii.	Global: 1,183 (WISE and AfSIS)
2.	soilIDrank
    a.	Random sample (US & Global)
        i.	Test random points using a dummy dataset that contains different degrees of data completeness.
        
            1.	 All data
            2.	Slope only (US testing)
            3.	All data - missing surface depth
            4.	All data - missing sub-surface depth
            5.	Subset of properties
                b.	Pedon test datasets (represent complete profiles with all data)
                    i.	Complete data
                    ii.	Subset of depths
                    iii.	Subset of properties

Stage 2: Code validation -- assess and improve accuracy

1.	soilIDlist: simple location-based ranking
    a.	Possible improvements based on optimized exponential decay function.
2.	soilIDRank: Gower’s generalized dissimilarity metric
    a.	Incorporate texture class and rock fragment class as ordinal values
    b.	Profile specific attributes
    c.	Optimize location weighting of data dissimilarity
